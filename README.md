# Learning_R

This repository contains R programming code and exercises that I have created while learning from W3Schools and their YouTube channel. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and to provide useful examples and snippets for others who are also learning R.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of R scripts and examples that I have worked on while learning R programming. The examples are primarily based on tutorials and exercises from W3Schools and their YouTube channel. This is a continuous learning project, and I will be updating this repository with new content as I progress.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine. You can download them from the following links:

-   [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
-   [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

\`\`\`sh git clone <https://github.com/Chakrastra/Learning_R.git>

Open the project in RStudio and start exploring the scripts.
